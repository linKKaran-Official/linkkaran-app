# The Green Interface Principles 🌿

> "Design is not what it looks like, but how it breathes."

## Core Aesthetics
The linKKaran interface is built to be a 'Natural Practitioner'. It should feel like walking through a quiet forest—calm, minimal, and essential.

### 1. Visual Calmness
- **Palette:** Earth tones, deep forest greens, and soft whites.
- **Minimalism:** Every pixel must serve a purpose. If it doesn't add value, it must be removed.

### 2. Respectful Presence
- No intrusive notifications or "loud" animations.
- The interface remains silent until the user initiates a dialogue.

### 3. Biological Geometry
- Using patterns found in nature (Golden Ratio, organic curves) to create a sense of familiarity and trust.
